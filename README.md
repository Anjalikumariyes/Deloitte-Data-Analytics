# Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage - February 2025

 * Completed a Deloitte job simulation involving data analysis and forensic
   technology 
 * Created a data dashboard using Tableau 
 * Used Excel to classify data and draw business conclusions

## Task 1 <a href = "https://github.com/Anjalikumariyes/Deloitte-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Task%201%20Data%20analysis/task1.pdf" >Link <a/>
Having your data unification algorithm, Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:
*	Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
*	Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
*	Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
*	Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
*	In which location did machines break the most?
*	What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

## Task 2
* The second task is to analyse the telemetry data collected by Daikibo (and unified with your algorithm) in a software called Tableau.
